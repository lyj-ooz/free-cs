When I started to learn programming, I couldn't understand why many people kept emphasizing the importance of computer science fundamentals for programmers. It didn't seem necessary because I could still get a job and write some lines of code without knowing it. (Honestly, I was pretty overwhelmed enough by all new concepts and couldn't be bothered to do study CS) But when I have gotten used to programming, I have become curious, "what's going on behind the scenes?" Also, when I do something, I want to do it right. I thought I could without a CS degree - well, people definitely can do it without the degree but not without CS fundamentals.

So, to teach me computer science, I am following [this](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). Wish me luck!

1. Programming [repo](https://github.com/lyj-ooz/free-cs/tree/1-programming)
2. Computer Architecture
3. Algorithms and Data Structures
4. Math for CS
5. Operating Systems
6. Computer Networking
7. Databases
8. Languages and Compilers
9. Distributed Systems (not sure)
